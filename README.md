Handbrake-Scripts
=================

What?
-----

A set of scripts for automating the process of ripping DVDs using HandBrakeCLI.

Why?
----

I'm in the process of archiving my DVD collection. This helps.

Requires
--------

Perl (Stock install should be fine for most modern distros.)

Future Ideas?
-------------

* Support a min/max title length.
* Support a list of DVD drives as an input.
* Support "Sleep on done"
* Develop a script to convert the plist files generated by the GUI app to command line args.
* Poner "profile" support.
