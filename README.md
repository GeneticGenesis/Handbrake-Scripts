Handbrake-Scripts
=================

What?
-----

A set of scripts for automating the process of ripping DVDs using HandBrakeCLI.

Why?
----

I'm in the process of archiving my DVD collection. This helps.


Future Ideas?
-------------

* Support a list of DVD drives as an input.
* Design a script to convert the plist files generated by the GUI app to command line args.
* Add own "profile" support.
